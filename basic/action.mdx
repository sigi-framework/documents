# Action

Sigi `EffectModule` was implemented by `State` object under the hood. `State` object is very similar with redux `Store` object. It **Dispatch** actions to `reducers` and `effects`, and receive actions from `Dispatcher` and `Effect`.

In sigi application, you will never need to create an `Action` by hand, so we do not expose the `Dispatch` function.
In replacement, there are two ways to dispatch action:

- call methods on **Dispatcher**
- emit actions in **Effect**

## Dispatcher & ActionsCreator

Dispatcher is a high level abstraction for **ActionsCreator** with well defined type information.

Every method in `EffectModule` class decorated by **Reducer**, **ImmerReducer**, **Effect** , **DefineAction** `Decorators` match one property with the same name in **ActionsCreator** in `EffectModule class`, and match one property with the same name in **Dispatcher** in `Component`. The **ActionsCreator** in `EffectModule class` is used for emit action in **Effect**, and the **Dispatcher** in `Component` is used for `Dispatch` actions to `State`.

### Dispatch props created by Redux-Actions

You may have used [Redux-Actions](https://github.com/redux-utilities/redux-actions) in **Redux** application. **ActionsCreator** in sigi is very similar with **ActionsCreator** in `Redux-Actions`.And there are few advantages for create **ActionsCreator** using `Redux-Actions`:

- Avoid [Magic string](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)>)
- Provide type information
- Reduce boilerplate codes

```ts
// raw dispatcher
connect(mapStateToProps, (dispatch) => bindActionCreators({
  addCount: (count: number) => dispatch({ // losing type information here
    type: 'ADD_COUNT',
    payload: count,
  }),
}, dispatch))

// reducer
export const reducer = (state, action) => { // losing type information here
  switch action.type:
    case: 'ADD_COUNT':
      return { ...state, count: state.count + payload }
    default:
      return { count: 0 }
}
```

```typescript
const ADD_COUNT = createAction<number>("ADD_COUNT");

interface DispatchProps {
  addOne: typeof ADD_COUNT;
}

interface StateProps {
  count: number;
}

// react actions dispatcher
connect(mapStateToProps, (dispatch) =>
  bindActionCreators(
    {
      addCount: ADD_COUNT,
    } as DispatchProps,
    dispatch
  )
);

// reducer
export const reducer = handleActions(
  {
    [`${ADD_COUNT}`]: (state: StateProps, { payload }: Action<number>) => {
      return { ...state, count: state.count + payload };
    },
  },
  { count: 0 }
);
```

### The Sigi way

#### Definition

```ts
import { Module, EffectModule, Reducer } from "@sigi/core";
interface State {
  count: number;
}

@Module("SomeNamespace")
class SomeModule extends EffectModule<State> {
  defaultState = {
    count: 0,
  };

  @Reducer()
  add(state: State, count: number) {
    return { ...state, count: state.count + count };
  }
}
```

> As you can see above, in the definition part of a sigi app, there is no magic action string,
> no redundant boilerplate ðŸ¤¯.

#### Usage

For react APP, we provide two hooks that let you refer actions defined in effect modules.
both of them receive a **EffectModule** class and produce a dispatcher referred to this module.

#### `useModule` and `useDispatchers`

```ts
// use module
import { useDispatchers, useModule } from "@sigi/react";

const SomeComponent = () => {
  // note: we don't need to worry about the types of dispatcher.
  // Sigi's type system will ensure all defined actions/effects are 100% accurate referred in dispatcher
  const [state, dispatcher] = useModule(SomeModule);
  // or, if you don't care about the state changes.
  // const dispatcher = useDispatchers(SomeModule);

  const onClickAdd = useCallback(() => {
    // ts will perform typecheck in the payload part
    // and you can also perform **Jump to definition** in code editor
    dispatcher.add(1);
    // ts type error
    // dispatch.add('string value')
  }, [dispatcher]);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={onClickAdd}>add 1</button>
      <span>count: {state.count}</span>
    </div>
  );
};
```
