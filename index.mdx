# Introduction

> **Sigi** is son of Odin ***(Oðin)***, the **Sig** in Sigi means victory because the name of Odin is ***Sigtýr***, which means ***The god of victory***. 


**Sigi** is a high level **Process manager** with well designed API which based on `RxJS` and `Immer`. Unlike others state management framenwork, **Sigi** focus on the ***Process management***, which usually come with ***State management*** requirement.

Of course **Sigi** also manage your state, but if you only want put some data in state, and really don't care how the data will be fetched, cached or staled, **Sigi** might too ***heavy*** for you.

**Sigi** is really good at manage the ***process*** of how the state changed, not just the state itself. With the benifit of `RxJS`, you can easily cancel the ongoing request when leaving page (`takeUntil`), or ignore the following event which will trigger ajax request when the first triggered one hasn't resposed yet (`exhaustMap`).

`RxJS` is the only way to manage process now, so you might need to know about [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/) before you get start. We will also provide `AsyncGenerator` API in future.

**Sigi** is written by `TypeScript`, and we **strongly recommand** using `Sigi` with `TypeScript`, we don't provide `JavaScript` version document now.
